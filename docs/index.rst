Concepts and Philosophy
=======================

pytest-html-plus is built to be a zero-config, minimal-overhead reporting companion for pytest users who need:

- Merged reports across multiple runs (no extra plugins required)
- Portable, readable HTML + optional email delivery
- Full traceability: logs, stdout/stderr, links, tags, durations — all embedded
- Simplicity — no JS/CSS archiving or bloated charts
