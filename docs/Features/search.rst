Universal Test Search + Smart Link Navigation
=============================================

The `pytest-html-plus` report comes with a powerful search bar at the top of the page, helping you find the test cases you care about in real-time.

Search and Navigate:
---------------------

Just start typing, and the dashboard will instantly filter and display tests based on:

✅ **Test name**

✅ **Linked external IDs** — such as JIRA, Testmo, Notion, or any quoted references you attach (e.g. `JIRA-123`, `DOC-456`, etc.)

✅ **Custom URLs or keywords** — any meaningful text or link in the associated references will be indexed.

.. tip::
   This smart search helps you **trace coverage**, **group tests by external references**, or **isolate unlinked cases** with ease.

For example, if you tag tests with a JIRA ID or Notion doc, typing that ID in the search bar will instantly filter all associated test cases for traceability.
