Ship reports with provenance â€” full run metadata included and copy-ready
=========================================================================

Every report generated by **pytest-html-plus** includes **automatic run metadata**,
so you always know *what* ran, *where*, and *when* â€” without extra configuration.

Included metadata fields:
- **Report title** (defaults to output filename)
- **Environment** â€” defaults to ``NA`` if not set.
  You can specify it using the ``--env`` or ``--environment`` option
  (these names are common in test automation workflows).
- **Branch** (detected from Git)
- **Commit SHA**
- **Generated timestamp**

.. note::
   Metadata is captured automatically â€” no extra setup required.

One-click copy
--------------
Each metadata section in the HTML report is **copy-ready**:
- **Copy the entire metadata block** in one click

One-click log & error sharing ðŸ“‹ðŸ”¥
=================================

Quickly copy traces, stdout/stderr, and error blocks with a single click â€” no manual selection, no messy copy-paste.

- âœ… Capture full stack traces, logs and screenshots in the report
- âœ… Copy any block (or the whole block) with one click and paste into your bug tracker, chat, or PR comment

Why it helps
------------
- **Instant reproducibility** â€” paste commit + test path to rerun the exact failing test
- **Faster triage** â€” share a single HTML file with full execution context
- **Audit-friendly** â€” every report carries provenance for compliance and traceability
